## Overview

Jungle Runner is a fun and addictive endless runner game developed as my first project using the Godot game engine. In this game, you take control of a character dashing through a dense jungle, dodging obstacles like logs, rocks, and wildlife, while collecting coins, power-ups, and other items to boost your score. The game features procedurally generated levels for endless replayability, simple mechanics suitable for all ages, and vibrant pixel-art style graphics inspired by classic platformers.

This repository contains the full source code for the game, including scenes, scripts, assets, and configuration files. It was built with Godot (version 4.x recommended), and the playable version is hosted on itch.io for easy access.

(HTML5 web version available ‚Äì no download required!)

## Features

- **Endless Runner Gameplay**: Procedurally generated jungle paths that get progressively harder, ensuring no two runs are the same.
- **Obstacles and Challenges**: Avoid pitfalls, jumping over hurdles, sliding under branches, and evading enemies like monkeys or snakes.
- **Collectibles and Power-Ups**: Gather coins for points, magnets to attract items, shields for temporary invincibility, and speed boosts for thrilling dashes.
- **Scoring System**: Track high scores with multipliers based on distance traveled and items collected. Compete with friends or aim for personal bests.
- **Audio and Visuals**: Custom sound effects for jumps, collisions, and pickups; background music that ramps up with intensity; and colorful 2D sprites for characters, environments, and UI.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Built in Godot, exportable to HTML5 (web), Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS.
- **Simple Customization**: Easy-to-modify scripts and assets for adding new features, levels, or themes.

## Installation

To run or modify the game locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Godot Engine**:
   - Download the latest version of Godot from the official website: [https://godotengine.org/download](https://godotengine.org/download).
   - This project is compatible with Godot 4.x (tested on 4.2+). Godot 3.x may require minor adjustments.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/shayanbalochofficial/Godot-FirstGame.git
   ```
   - Navigate to the project folder: `cd Godot-FirstGame`.

3. **Open in Godot**:
   - Launch Godot and import the project by selecting the `project.godot` file in the root directory.
   - Godot will automatically load all scenes, scripts, and assets.

4. **Dependencies**:
   - No external plugins or add-ons are required ‚Äì everything is built with Godot's built-in features and GDScript.
   - If assets like audio or images are missing (e.g., due to gitignore), they can be recreated or sourced from free asset packs (e.g., from Kenney.nl or OpenGameArt.org).

## Usage

### Running the Game in Godot Editor
- Press `F5` (or click the "Play" button) to run the main scene.
- The default main scene is typically `main.tscn` or `game.tscn` (check `project.godot` for the entry point).
- Use the editor's debugger to test mechanics, tweak values, or add new elements.

### Exporting the Game
1. In Godot, go to **Project > Export**.
2. Add presets for your target platform (e.g., HTML5 for web deployment).
3. Export the project ‚Äì for web, upload the generated files to a host like itch.io.
4. For desktop exports, run the resulting executable.

### Building from Source
- If modifying scripts (e.g., in `scripts/` directory), save changes and rerun.
- Example: To adjust player speed, edit the `player.gd` script's velocity variables.

## Controls

- **Movement**: Auotmatic infinite running.
- **Jump**: Spacebar or Up Arrow to jump over obstacles.

(Controls are customizable in the input map via Godot's project settings.)

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the repository's key files and directories (based on standard Godot project layout):

- **`project.godot`**: The main project configuration file. Defines settings like window size, physics, and main scene.
- **`icon.png` / `default_env.tres`**: Project icon and default environment settings.
- **`scenes/`**: Contains .tscn files for game scenes.
  - `main.tscn`: Entry point with menu and HUD.
  - `level.tscn`: The core gameplay scene with procedural generation.
  - `player.tscn`: Player character node with animations and collision.
- **`scripts/`**: GDScript (.gd) files for logic.
  - `player.gd`: Handles movement, jumping, sliding, and collision detection.
  - `obstacle_spawner.gd`: Script for spawning obstacles and collectibles.
  - `score_manager.gd`: Tracks and displays scores.
- **`assets/`**: Art, audio, and other resources.
  - `sprites/`: PNG files for player, obstacles, background (e.g., jungle tileset).
  - `audio/`: WAV/MP3 files for sound effects and music.
  - `fonts/`: TTF files for UI text.
- **`addons/`**: (If any) Optional Godot add-ons for extra features.
- **`.gitignore`**: Ignores temporary files like .import directories.
- **`LICENSE`**: MIT License file.

This structure follows Godot best practices for organization and scalability.

## Development Notes

- **Inspiration**: This game was created as a learning project following beginner Godot tutorials (from youtube). It demonstrates core concepts like 2D physics, node hierarchies, signals, and animation players.
- **Tools Used**:
  - Godot Engine (free and open-source).
  - GDScript for scripting.
- **Known Issues**:
  - Performance may vary on low-end devices due to procedural generation.
  - No mobile touch controls implemented yet (planned for future updates).
- **Future Plans**:
  - Add leaderboards via SilentWolf or similar.
  - More levels/themes (e.g., desert or cave runners).
  - Multiplayer mode for competitive runs.
